fractalGraph
============

Generates and plots fractal graphs as described in Mandelbrot's "A Fractal Walk Down Wall Street", which should loosely model stock market price graphs using fractal logic.

This project requires `matlibplot` in order to create graphs (http://matplotlib.org/).

_apt-get_

```
> sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
```

_yum_

```
su -c "yum-builddep python-matplotlib"
```


#### Example Plots

Below are some example plots made by changing the initial coordinates (which act as the fractal template). Some look strange and do not look as if they would accurately model stock market actions, however, given particular initial conditions, the graphs do bear some resemblance. 

This project was done more as an excersize on fractal recursion than as an in-depth study on the viability of using fractals to model or predict stock market trends.
